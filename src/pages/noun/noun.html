                Nouns are words that refer to people, places, or things. They are the very foundation of our spoken and written language. Without nouns there would be no substance and no subject to our sentences.

                <strong>Remember that the best way to find nouns in sentences is to ask who, what, and where- the 
                    answers will usually point you towards the nouns. Also keep in mind that the majority of the time nouns 
                    are things you can see and touch- car, bike, boy, dog, school, Mom, Sally, and Billy. However, there are 
                    also times when intangible things can be nouns- time, love, hate, fear, guilt,
                     passion, wind, air, satisfaction, quality, and so forth.</strong>
